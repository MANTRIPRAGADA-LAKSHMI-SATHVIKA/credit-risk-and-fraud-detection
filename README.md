# Credit Risk and Fraud Detection Reports

This repository contains two PDF reports showcasing end-to-end machine learning workflows for:

1. **Credit Risk Modeling**  
   - Goal: Predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan  
   - Models used: Logistic Regression, LightGBM  
   - Dataset: UCI Credit Card Clients Dataset

2. **Fraud Detection**  
   - Goal: Identify fraudulent financial transactions  
   - Techniques used: SMOTE for class imbalance, Random Forest, Isolation Forest  
   - Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection

Each project includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics: F1-score, AUC-ROC
- Final summarized PDF report
